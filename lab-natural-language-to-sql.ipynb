        "I tested three versions of prompts with varying levels of structure and examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "🧱 Prompt Variations\n",
        "Version\tDescription\tOutput Quality\n",
        "V1\tSimple, direct prompt with clear schema and question\t✅ Accurate, concise SQL, baseline format\n",
        "V2\tConversational style with context (e.g., “You are an expert analyst”)\t✅ More natural and human-like SQL, consistent JOINs\n",
        "V3\tFew-shot style with example query + new question\t✅ Best performance overall; followed pattern perfectly\n",
        "🧠 Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "Clear schema descriptions significantly improved the model’s accuracy.\n",
        "Ambiguity in column or table names led to hallucinations or mismatched joins.\n",
        "\n",
        "Few-shot prompting (V3) gave the most consistent, production-ready SQL, proving that examples are a strong learning signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural-language style prompts (V2) made queries more readable but didn’t improve precision much over V1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Language sensitivity: When questions were phrased in Spanish or grammatically complex English, the model occasionally produced partial or invalid SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantization (4-bit) didn’t noticeably reduce output quality — generation was still fast and stable within a 16 GB GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ Cases That Didn’t Work Well\n",
        "\n",
        "When schema names were inconsistent (e.g., using emp instead of employee), the model hallucinated unknown tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without explicit join keys or schema details, it sometimes guessed relationships incorrectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Very long prompts (>400 tokens) sometimes caused truncated SQL due to max token limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 Key Learnings\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt clarity is more important than model size — even a 7B model can outperform larger ones if well-prompted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Few-shot learning is extremely powerful for style transfer (e.g., enforcing consistent SQL format).\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is highly specialized in SQL but less multilingual — effective mostly in English.\n",
        "\n",
        "Well-structured prompts with clear sections (### Instructions, ### Input, ### Response) dramatically reduce errors.\n",
